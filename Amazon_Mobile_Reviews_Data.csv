0,B07WZG2YR3,Mi 10,SAIF RAZA,Heating issue,4.0,All are okk but mobile heating problem so high.I suggest you guys plz don't buy this device.
1,B07WZG2YR3,Mi 10,nitin panwar,Good phone (Pros & Cons simplified),1.0,"Hi guys,In general the phone is nice and does manages to provide you the feeling of a premium phone. However there are some flaws which I witnessed over my experience till date. So let me provide you the Pros and Cons of the phone -PROS...1. Nice built quality and comfortable to hold.2. Excellent performance.3. Symmetric stereo speakers. (Better experience while watching videos or playing games)4. Nice camera with with very good quality low light or night photography which still many flagship phones lack.5. Up to the mark 90Hz refresh rate display.6. Amoled screen brightness is excellent and there is no issue in viewing display even while the display is directly facing towards the sun.7. Excellent charging with 30 watts wired and wireless charging. I tried charging the phone from dead 0 to 100 and achieved it just under 1 hour. (In my personal opinion I don't think higher charging wattage like 65 watts is good for phone battery and sounds like a gimmick as even though they have double the wattage they usually charge a phone of smaller battery about 4000 mAH in about 40 minutes which is not much of a difference. )8. Super steady video from rear camera because of presence of both EIS & OIS.9.Bigger battery 4780 mAH as compared to other flagship phones.10. Doesn't misses out on any feature like reverse wireless charging, 5g support (though in India not of use for at least couple of years), NFC, Dual GPS, capable of being connected to wifi and provide Hotspot simultaneously, No MIUI ads till date.CONS...1. The limitation of resolution of the screen FHD+. The bigger size of the screen results in lower ppi and thus stands nowhere near QHD+ displays.2. This phone comes with Global MIUI 11 and has Google dialer and messaging app thus misses out features like call recording, phone notes etc. (Reason being in many countries like UAE it is illegal to have call recording apps or VPN apps. )3. Trust me this MIUI has a lot of bugs and thus results in issues like while using finger print scanner, the device heats up at times even during normal usage, but the overall performance is acceptable. (Hopefully most of the issues will be resolved by MIUI 12 update which is going to be available soon)4. Outdated front camera and supporting rear cameras hardware. (The 20 MP front camera and that too without EIS, 2 MP macro camera, 2 MP depth camera and 13 MP ultrawide camera seems like a joke for a 2020 flagship phone with the price of 50k.)5. The battery is bigger compared to many devices but looses about 10 to 20% even when left untouched overnight thus I'd say not so good battery management.6. Misses out a 3.5 mm Jack and also the c type to 3.5 mm Jack converter provided in the box doesn't seem to be of a very good quality as per my initial impression.7. Though the low light photography is good but daylight photography is not that exceptional as one might expect from 108 MP camera.8. I felt that the call quality is not up to the mark. (Maybe just in my case)Pricing issues - Though there are two things which have gone against Xiaomi as well as other Mobile brands1) Increment in GST rates from 12% to 18%2) Higher import duties for imported phones.I think that the phone is slightly overpriced at 50k but if we compare it with it`s biggest competitor the One plus 8 I will always choose MI 10 as so many things are missing in One plus 8 (like wireless charging, LP DDR RAM 4x is present instead of 5, comes with smaller battery 4300mAH and Sony IMX 586 Camera sensor which is quite outdated now) and have a price difference of only 5k.  Even that can be narrowed down by using bank offers if available which was there in my case. However in comparison with One plus 8 pro I feel that MI 10 is slightly behind because of the MIUI bugs related flaws, FHD+ display and outdated secondary camera hardware (including front camera. Thus I believe that if the aforementioned issues would have been addressed by Xiaomi I would have considered this phone justifying the price completely and without a doubt would have been the best phone ever under 50k. However in reality still the phone is definitely a strong competitor in the flagship mobile segment."

61,B07WZG2YR3,Mi 10,nitin panwar,Good phone (Pros & Cons simplified),1.0,"Hi guys,In general the phone is nice and does manages to provide you the feeling of a premium phone. However there are some flaws which I witnessed over my experience till date. So let me provide you the Pros and Cons of the phone -PROS...1. Nice built quality and comfortable to hold.2. Excellent performance.3. Symmetric stereo speakers. (Better experience while watching videos or playing games)4. Nice camera with with very good quality low light or night photography which still many flagship phones lack.5. Up to the mark 90Hz refresh rate display.6. Amoled screen brightness is excellent and there is no issue in viewing display even while the display is directly facing towards the sun.7. Excellent charging with 30 watts wired and wireless charging. I tried charging the phone from dead 0 to 100 and achieved it just under 1 hour. (In my personal opinion I don't think higher charging wattage like 65 watts is good for phone battery and sounds like a gimmick as even though they have double the wattage they usually charge a phone of smaller battery about 4000 mAH in about 40 minutes which is not much of a difference. )8. Super steady video from rear camera because of presence of both EIS & OIS.9.Bigger battery 4780 mAH as compared to other flagship phones.10. Doesn't misses out on any feature like reverse wireless charging, 5g support (though in India not of use for at least couple of years), NFC, Dual GPS, capable of being connected to wifi and provide Hotspot simultaneously, No MIUI ads till date.CONS...1. The limitation of resolution of the screen FHD+. The bigger size of the screen results in lower ppi and thus stands nowhere near QHD+ displays.2. This phone comes with Global MIUI 11 and has Google dialer and messaging app thus misses out features like call recording, phone notes etc. (Reason being in many countries like UAE it is illegal to have call recording apps or VPN apps. )3.

200,B0869BGNLD,OPPO Find X2,Sudhir Sen,Not a phone for everyone,5.0,"This phone makes sense only for a very specific set of people. Bought this after a lot of deliberation on whether to go the one plus way or the oppo find x.  I am a person who uses an S9, and super heavy user. Atleast 2 full charges a day. Not for games but professional use. emails, conf calls and video.Chose this one barely on three factors.In 30 min you get near full charge. This phone is worth for that one reason.Screen, a 120hz screen does make a huge difference compared to S9 that I own.Speaker - One of the best speakers.Plus 5k discount and a one-time screen replacement warranty.Cons - The charger shape is not ideal. If I plug it in, it interferes with the next plug point or the switch. Should have been lighter and the cable should have been higher quality.ColorOS 7.1 actually turned out to be way better than I thought. It is minimalist, material design, and fast. But still should have provided an option to remove the few remaining out of the box apps.I don't worry about IP68 and Camera. In the last 15 years, I have dropped the phone only once in the pool, but at least 5 of them have got a broken screen.  I don't use the camera on the phone much. So that was never a factor.I just looked at how I have used the other phones for the last 10 years and counting what made sense for my usage leaving all other things out."
201,B0869BGNLD,OPPO Find X2,Vishwankit Sinha,Absolute Beast With Bestest Display 🥰,3.0,I Can't even think at any point of time that it's been that easy for me to Back to Android after using Iphone 11.But after using Oppo Find X2 my thoughts were totally blown away by the performance I got. I Just Loved the Build Quality and can’t Even tell u about the display but I can tell u one thing that Oppo Find X2 has the best display in any Smartphone on Planet Earth till today.The way it charges the battery with 65W SuperVooc charger is insane.Let me Tell u About Some Pros first-1.Display Is the Bestest In any Smartphone Ever2.Flawless performance from the best Chipset Inside3.World's Fastest Charging Phone4.Superfast Read n Write Speed through UFS 3.1 storage5. Good Camera not the best needs some Software Upgrades6.Better Haptic Motor as Compared to other flagships7.Best Sound In this Price Range or In Android MarketNow I have To talk about Cons -1. Battery Backup is not upto flagship level but it's not hurt that much because of 65W SuperVooc Charger2.Always got Accidental touches due to It's Curve Display3.Bit Slippery and got Fingerprint on Its back glass4.No Hardcase provided in the Box and the Quality of pre-applied screen protector is bad5.Not a Single Good Quality Screen Protector or Case Found on anywhere till now that's a bit annoying for me .But I highly Recommend to go with this one 😊Oppo Find X2 is real Flagship of 2020

203,B0869BGNLD,OPPO Find X2,Ananthan9398,Flagship from Oppo !,5.0,"Display is top notch. Video Streaming is an absolute pleasure using this phone. Ultra Vision Engine and Dolby Atmos stands out.Charging from 0 to 100 in around 45 mins.Photos were good. Videos were far better than I expected . Auto Focussing speed and Stability were the highlights.UI is clean . Color Os is definetely getting better.No heating issues as of now. I got a clear 7 hrs ON-screen time with heavy usage On 120 Hz , Auto Fhd-Qhd .It was just a day of use and I'll update my thoughts after spending more time.EDIT -I have attatched camera samples .After 3 weeks of use -1. Display is one of the best.2. Video streaming- I had one of the best experience using Netflix and Youtube.3. Charging and battery - The battery lasts 7 hrs on heavy usage constantly and can be fully charged under 40 minutes . The battery standby is also good.4. Camera is good and it depends on the individuals use , as to what that person demands from the cam. I had a good experience with it. Front camera was really good and gave decent selfies.I did observe a dynamic range difference when shifting from normal to ultrawide sensor.5. No heating issues during heavy usage and charging . But did observe some while recording video . The regions around the rear cam gets heated up during recording. But that was not much of an issue .6. UI was okayish but could definitely improve. I was using Oneplus 5 for 3 years and shift from oxygen to color OS was observable. One hand mode was of great use .7. The curved edges and design are beautiful . The case sent along with the phone was also good. The charger wires could have been of better quality. (There is also an unavailability of other quality cases for the phone.)8. I had been waiting to buy Oneplus 8 pro but due to its unavailability and display issues , I went for this one and I do not regret about it . Its almost identical to what Oneplus has to offer except for the smaller ultrawide camera sensors and an increase in price by 5k . The price would have been perfect at around 55k-60k.Final Verdict -It depends on the persons preference . If you are a person who would want a premium feel smartphone with excellent display, video streming experience , good design, good camera setup and fast charging : Go for this one . It would definitely win your hearts - a quality product from Oppo."

Initially, little sceptical to invest 65K on oppo. But after product delivered, my overall experience with oppo totally changed.I was aware that oneplus is manufactured by oppo, hence quality & durability never a barrier. Oneplus marketed in online & Oppo in offline that’s the difference, rest everything is same.Coming to the product – OPPO Find X2It impress me from the 1st impression, which is box of product. They make sure customer feel premium from first look itself, have to admit they invest lot in box.Screen: That’s the main USP of product, I used apple, samsung earlier but find x2 is best of best in terms of screen. Be it 120Hz refresh rate or resolution everything is best. It has eye protection & flicker free screen so now worry about web-series.Charging: 65W charging unbelievable, I never have to wait for charging my phone. Just plug in and you phone is ready for single day. After watching Netflix for 2 hours only 5% battery consumed.Processor: I has best qualcomm 865 processor, just don’t think about slow speed. Its history now.5G enabled: Cherry on the cake, what better can expect from any flagship phone. You don’t have to think for next two year to upgrade the phone.Wifi 6: Never thought wifi version make such a difference in network speed, lag free, never found any delay in opening any page.Overall, this is best phone in the premium segment. Don’t think twice, if you really want to purchase phone not invest on Brand, then go for OPPO Find X2."

The case sent along with the phone was also good. The charger wires could have been of better quality. (There is also an unavailability of other quality cases for the phone.)8. I had been waiting to buy Oneplus 8 pro but due to its unavailability and display issues , I went for this one and I do not regret about it . Its almost identical to what Oneplus has to offer except for the smaller ultrawide camera sensors and an increase in price by 5k . The price would have been perfect at around 55k-60k.Final Verdict -It depends on the persons preference . If you are a person who would want a premium feel smartphone with excellent display, video streming experience , good design, good camera setup and fast charging : Go for this one . It would definitely win your hearts - a quality product from Oppo."

230,B0869BGNLD,OPPO Find X2,Sudhir Sen,Not a phone for everyone,5.0,"This phone makes sense only for a very specific set of people. Bought this after a lot of deliberation on whether to go the one plus way or the oppo find x.  I am a person who uses an S9, and super heavy user. Atleast 2 full charges a day. Not for games but professional use. emails, conf calls and video.Chose this one barely on three factors.In 30 min you get near full charge. This phone is worth for that one reason.Screen, a 120hz screen does make a huge difference compared to S9 that I own.Speaker - One of the best speakers.Plus 5k discount and a one-time screen replacement warranty.Cons - The charger shape is not ideal. If I plug it in, it interferes with the next plug point or the switch. Should have been lighter and the cable should have been higher quality.ColorOS 7.1 actually turned out to be way better than I thought. It is minimalist, material design, and fast. But still should have provided an option to remove the few remaining out of the box apps.I don't worry about IP68 and Camera. In the last 15 years, I have dropped the phone only once in the pool, but at least 5 of them have got a broken screen.  I don't use the camera on the phone much. So that was never a factor.I just looked at how I have used the other phones for the last 10 years and counting what made sense for my usage leaving all other things out."

Oneplus marketed in online & Oppo in offline that’s the difference, rest everything is same.Coming to the product – OPPO Find X2It impress me from the 1st impression, which is box of product. They make sure customer feel premium from first look itself, have to admit they invest lot in box.Screen: That’s the main USP of product, I used apple, samsung earlier but find x2 is best of best in terms of screen. Be it 120Hz refresh rate or resolution everything is best. It has eye protection & flicker free screen so now worry about web-series.Charging: 65W charging unbelievable, I never have to wait for charging my phone. Just plug in and you phone is ready for single day. After watching Netflix for 2 hours only 5% battery consumed.Processor: I has best qualcomm 865 processor, just don’t think about slow speed. Its history now.5G enabled: Cherry on the cake, what better can expect from any flagship phone. You don’t have to think for next two year to upgrade the phone.Wifi 6: Never thought wifi version make such a difference in network speed, lag free, never found any delay in opening any page.Overall, this is best phone in the premium segment. Don’t think twice, if you really want to purchase phone not invest on Brand, then go for OPPO Find X2."

260,B0869BGNLD,OPPO Find X2,Sudhir Sen,Not a phone for everyone,5.0,"This phone makes sense only for a very specific set of people. Bought this after a lot of deliberation on whether to go the one plus way or the oppo find x.  I am a person who uses an S9, and super heavy user. Atleast 2 full charges a day. Not for games but professional use. emails, conf calls and video.Chose this one barely on three factors.In 30 min you get near full charge. This phone is worth for that one reason.Screen, a 120hz screen does make a huge difference compared to S9 that I own.Speaker - One of the best speakers.Plus 5k discount and a one-time screen replacement warranty.Cons - The charger shape is not ideal. If I plug it in, it interferes with the next plug point or the switch. Should have been lighter and the cable should have been higher quality.ColorOS 7.1 actually turned out to be way better than I thought. It is minimalist, material design, and fast. But still should have provided an option to remove the few remaining out of the box apps.I don't worry about IP68 and Camera. In the last 15 years, I have dropped the phone only once in the pool, but at least 5 of them have got a broken screen.  I don't use the camera on the phone much. So that was never a factor.I just looked at how I have used the other phones for the last 10 years and counting what made sense for my usage leaving all other things out."

Good Camera not the best needs some Software Upgrades6.Better Haptic Motor as Compared to other flagships7.Best Sound In this Price Range or In Android MarketNow I have To talk about Cons -1. Battery Backup is not upto flagship level but it's not hurt that much because of 65W SuperVooc Charger2.Always got Accidental touches due to It's Curve Display3.Bit Slippery and got Fingerprint on Its back glass4.No Hardcase provided in the Box and the Quality of pre-applied screen protector is bad5.Not a Single Good Quality Screen Protector or Case Found on anywhere till now that's a bit annoying for me .But I highly Recommend to go with this one 😊Oppo Find X2 is real Flagship of 2020

263,B0869BGNLD,OPPO Find X2,Ananthan9398,Flagship from Oppo !,5.0,"Display is top notch. Video Streaming is an absolute pleasure using this phone. Ultra Vision Engine and Dolby Atmos stands out.Charging from 0 to 100 in around 45 mins.Photos were good. Videos were far better than I expected . Auto Focussing speed and Stability were the highlights.UI is clean . Color Os is definetely getting better.No heating issues as of now. I got a clear 7 hrs ON-screen time with heavy usage On 120 Hz , Auto Fhd-Qhd .It was just a day of use and I'll update my thoughts after spending more time.EDIT -I have attatched camera samples .After 3 weeks of use -1. Display is one of the best.2. Video streaming- I had one of the best experience using Netflix and Youtube.3. Charging and battery - The battery lasts 7 hrs on heavy usage constantly and can be fully charged under 40 minutes . The battery standby is also good.4. Camera is good and it depends on the individuals use , as to what that person demands from the cam. I had a good experience with it. Front camera was really good and gave decent selfies.I did observe a dynamic range difference when shifting from normal to ultrawide sensor.5. No heating issues during heavy usage and charging . But did observe some while recording video . The regions around the rear cam gets heated up during recording. But that was not much of an issue .6. UI was okayish but could definitely improve. I was using Oneplus 5 for 3 years and shift from oxygen to color OS was observable. One hand mode was of great use .7. The curved edges and design are beautiful . The case sent along with the phone was also good. The charger wires could have been of better quality. (There is also an unavailability of other quality cases for the phone.)8. I had been waiting to buy Oneplus 8 pro but due to its unavailability and display issues , I went for this one and I do not regret about it . Its almost identical to what Oneplus has to offer except for the smaller ultrawide camera sensors and an increase in price by 5k . The price would have been perfect at around 55k-60k.Final Verdict -It depends on the persons preference . If you are a person who would want a premium feel smartphone with excellent display, video streming experience , good design, good camera setup and fast charging : Go for this one . It would definitely win your hearts - a quality product from Oppo."

290,B0869BGNLD,OPPO Find X2,Sudhir Sen,Not a phone for everyone,5.0,"This phone makes sense only for a very specific set of people. Bought this after a lot of deliberation on whether to go the one plus way or the oppo find x.  I am a person who uses an S9, and super heavy user. Atleast 2 full charges a day. Not for games but professional use. emails, conf calls and video.Chose this one barely on three factors.In 30 min you get near full charge. This phone is worth for that one reason.Screen, a 120hz screen does make a huge difference compared to S9 that I own.Speaker - One of the best speakers.Plus 5k discount and a one-time screen replacement warranty.Cons - The charger shape is not ideal. If I plug it in, it interferes with the next plug point or the switch. Should have been lighter and the cable should have been higher quality.ColorOS 7.1 actually turned out to be way better than I thought. It is minimalist, material design, and fast. But still should have provided an option to remove the few remaining out of the box apps.I don't worry about IP68 and Camera. In the last 15 years, I have dropped the phone only once in the pool, but at least 5 of them have got a broken screen.  I don't use the camera on the phone much. So that was never a factor.I just looked at how I have used the other phones for the last 10 years and counting what made sense for my usage leaving all other things out."
291,B0869BGNLD,OPPO Find X2,Vishwankit Sinha,Absolute Beast With Bestest Display 🥰,3.0,I Can't even think at any point of time that it's been that easy for me to Back to Android after using Iphone 11.But after using Oppo Find X2 my thoughts were totally blown away by the performance I got. I Just Loved the Build Quality and can’t Even tell u about the display but I can tell u one thing that Oppo Find X2 has the best display in any Smartphone on Planet Earth till today.The way it charges the battery with 65W SuperVooc charger is insane.Let me Tell u About Some Pros first-1.Display Is the Bestest In any Smartphone Ever2.Flawless performance from the best Chipset Inside3.World's Fastest Charging Phone4.Superfast Read n Write Speed through UFS 3.1 storage5. Good Camera not the best needs some Software Upgrades6.Better Haptic Motor as Compared to other flagships7.Best Sound In this Price Range or In Android MarketNow I have To talk about Cons -1. Battery Backup is not upto flagship level but it's not hurt that much because of 65W SuperVooc Charger2.Always got Accidental touches due to It's Curve Display3.Bit Slippery and got Fingerprint on Its back glass4.No Hardcase provided in the Box and the Quality of pre-applied screen protector is bad5.Not a Single Good Quality Screen Protector or Case Found on anywhere till now that's a bit annoying for me .But I highly Recommend to go with this one 😊Oppo Find X2 is real Flagship of 2020

293,B0869BGNLD,OPPO Find X2,Ananthan9398,Flagship from Oppo !,5.0,"Display is top notch. Video Streaming is an absolute pleasure using this phone. Ultra Vision Engine and Dolby Atmos stands out.Charging from 0 to 100 in around 45 mins.Photos were good. Videos were far better than I expected . Auto Focussing speed and Stability were the highlights.UI is clean . Color Os is definetely getting better.No heating issues as of now. I got a clear 7 hrs ON-screen time with heavy usage On 120 Hz , Auto Fhd-Qhd .It was just a day of use and I'll update my thoughts after spending more time.EDIT -I have attatched camera samples .After 3 weeks of use -1. Display is one of the best.2. Video streaming- I had one of the best experience using Netflix and Youtube.3. Charging and battery - The battery lasts 7 hrs on heavy usage constantly and can be fully charged under 40 minutes . The battery standby is also good.4. Camera is good and it depends on the individuals use , as to what that person demands from the cam. I had a good experience with it. Front camera was really good and gave decent selfies.I did observe a dynamic range difference when shifting from normal to ultrawide sensor.5. No heating issues during heavy usage and charging . But did observe some while recording video . The regions around the rear cam gets heated up during recording. But that was not much of an issue .6. UI was okayish but could definitely improve. I was using Oneplus 5 for 3 years and shift from oxygen to color OS was observable. One hand mode was of great use .7. The curved edges and design are beautiful . The case sent along with the phone was also good. The charger wires could have been of better quality. (There is also an unavailability of other quality cases for the phone.)8. I had been waiting to buy Oneplus 8 pro but due to its unavailability and display issues , I went for this one and I do not regret about it . Its almost identical to what Oneplus has to offer except for the smaller ultrawide camera sensors and an increase in price by 5k . The price would have been perfect at around 55k-60k.Final Verdict -It depends on the persons preference . If you are a person who would want a premium feel smartphone with excellent display, video streming experience , good design, good camera setup and fast charging : Go for this one . It would definitely win your hearts - a quality product from Oppo."

Speed and 120hz refresh rate is adding more to the phone,4. Battery life is little concern but over all superb phone.I brought it on first day sale , this phone looks premium , curved display, ceramic back, super grip.Overall it's superb better than one plus 8 pro..."
295,B0869BGNLD,OPPO Find X2,Neha,OPPO Findx2  Elegant phone with best of technology,5.0,"Read about the products reviews everywhere from youtube to news articles. Initially, little sceptical to invest 65K on oppo. But after product delivered, my overall experience with oppo totally changed.I was aware that oneplus is manufactured by oppo, hence quality & durability never a barrier. Oneplus marketed in online & Oppo in offline that’s the difference, rest everything is same.Coming to the product – OPPO Find X2It impress me from the 1st impression, which is box of product. They make sure customer feel premium from first look itself, have to admit they invest lot in box.Screen: That’s the main USP of product, I used apple, samsung earlier but find x2 is best of best in terms of screen. Be it 120Hz refresh rate or resolution everything is best. It has eye protection & flicker free screen so now worry about web-series.Charging: 65W charging unbelievable, I never have to wait for charging my phone. Just plug in and you phone is ready for single day. After watching Netflix for 2 hours only 5% battery consumed.Processor: I has best qualcomm 865 processor, just don’t think about slow speed. Its history now.5G enabled: Cherry on the cake, what better can expect from any flagship phone. You don’t have to think for next two year to upgrade the phone.Wifi 6: Never thought wifi version make such a difference in network speed, lag free, never found any delay in opening any page.Overall, this is best phone in the premium segment. Don’t think twice, if you really want to purchase phone not invest on Brand, then go for OPPO Find X2."

300,B07DJLVJ5M,OnePlus 7T,Praggya,Think and evaluate before you go for it,4.0,"After reading a lot of geeky reviews on YouTube and portals, I bought Oneplus7t. Pls, note I have been using OnePlus from last many years now so my expectations were clear. My experience with the device says that most of the reviews or unboxing things are influenced. Pls, note I have bought it with my own money unlike leading reviewers or unboxing video geeks who get it for free. So pls don't go by them blindly. Go for users reviews who bought them with their own money. So I am writing my 5 days experience with the phone.I am not a gamer or a geek. A regular user who wants to do all the office work on the phone, social media, blogging and vlogging, etc.The last OnePlus phone I was using was Oneplus 5 and was quite happy with it until it screen got broken and replacement cost was higher than the selling price of the device itself.The day it arrived from Amazon I opened it with a lot of excitement which continued till I have held it in my hands.Here are the issues:1. Weight: It weighed too much I felt like holding a brick. And it is thick. When I hold it in one hand for a few minutes I get a deep red pit in my hand (due to blood circulation).2. Camera: Then I had to go for a conference there I tried clicking pictures. Picture quality did not come out well. Still, I thought it may be light or background because of my previous experiences I could not believe it to be not good. So I continued clicking pictures which really missed detailing. As you zoom in it will make it blurred. I have clicked a magazine cover picture with my Oneplus 5 which had only 16 MP camera but pic quality was natural and good. It clicks blur pics may it has to do with image Stabilization.3. Battery:  Battery is avg. All those time I teased my iPhone or Samsung Series colleagues and friends for their battery life. Welcome to the league. This offers an avg battery life. I never carried a charger with me in previous models if I Start with 90% even after two years. But here I have to carry it even for the average usage. I m wondering what would be this phone battery life in a year or more.4. 90 Hz refresh rate is a gimmick to sell this device. It will give you fluid experience but the soon it consumes battery you will always prefer to keep it to 60hz which is an option given in the display settings. If you always stick to a desk or have a power source around you can keep it to 90hz. Not for people who are on the move most of the time. Don't fall for it.5. Sound: It's average. Phone calls are not crisp and clear. At times the caller's voice gets hazy and husky. Voice is even audible to person the person sitting next to me. Even on lower volumes. Speakers volume is loud but the sound quality is not good.6. No premium-feeling anymore. With multiple variants, it has joined the league of Samsung, Mi, Oppo, Vivo. Now they are launching 7t pro on Oct 10 again it is a disappointment for those who bought 7t on day 1. Maybe their R&D or trials have some problem here that in every two months they are launching a new device with an update to the previous faults. Like OnePlus 7 has voice receiver on one side which is right. So if you take calls or hear the phone from left you won't get a clear voice or volume. So they added receivers on both the side in this device.I am still not getting why I have spent Rs 40,000 on it. No camera quality, no battery life, no sound quality on calls, getting wounds on holding it for long.I have always recommended OnePlus devices to everyone around and had high hopes and trust on the brand that I bought it on the day of the launch but with this experience, I won't recommend OnePlus 7t to my colleagues and friends who are planning to upgrade their devices."

If you always stick to a desk or have a power source around you can keep it to 90hz. Not for people who are on the move most of the time. Don't fall for it.5. Sound: It's average. Phone calls are not crisp and clear. At times the caller's voice gets hazy and husky. Voice is even audible to person the person sitting next to me. Even on lower volumes. Speakers volume is loud but the sound quality is not good.6. No premium-feeling anymore. With multiple variants, it has joined the league of Samsung, Mi, Oppo, Vivo. Now they are launching 7t pro on Oct 10 again it is a disappointment for those who bought 7t on day 1. Maybe their R&D or trials have some problem here that in every two months they are launching a new device with an update to the previous faults. Like OnePlus 7 has voice receiver on one side which is right. So if you take calls or hear the phone from left you won't get a clear voice or volume. So they added receivers on both the side in this device.I am still not getting why I have spent Rs 40,000 on it. No camera quality, no battery life, no sound quality on calls, getting wounds on holding it for long.I have always recommended OnePlus devices to everyone around and had high hopes and trust on the brand that I bought it on the day of the launch but with this experience, I won't recommend OnePlus 7t to my colleagues and friends who are planning to upgrade their devices."

360,B07DJLVJ5M,OnePlus 7T,Praggya,Think and evaluate before you go for it,4.0,"After reading a lot of geeky reviews on YouTube and portals, I bought Oneplus7t. Pls, note I have been using OnePlus from last many years now so my expectations were clear. My experience with the device says that most of the reviews or unboxing things are influenced. Pls, note I have bought it with my own money unlike leading reviewers or unboxing video geeks who get it for free. So pls don't go by them blindly. Go for users reviews who bought them with their own money. So I am writing my 5 days experience with the phone.I am not a gamer or a geek. A regular user who wants to do all the office work on the phone, social media, blogging and vlogging, etc.The last OnePlus phone I was using was Oneplus 5 and was quite happy with it until it screen got broken and replacement cost was higher than the selling price of the device itself.The day it arrived from Amazon I opened it with a lot of excitement which continued till I have held it in my hands.Here are the issues:1. Weight: It weighed too much I felt like holding a brick. And it is thick. When I hold it in one hand for a few minutes I get a deep red pit in my hand (due to blood circulation).2. Camera: Then I had to go for a conference there I tried clicking pictures. Picture quality did not come out well. Still, I thought it may be light or background because of my previous experiences I could not believe it to be not good. So I continued clicking pictures which really missed detailing. As you zoom in it will make it blurred. I have clicked a magazine cover picture with my Oneplus 5 which had only 16 MP camera but pic quality was natural and good. It clicks blur pics may it has to do with image Stabilization.3. Battery:  Battery is avg. All those time I teased my iPhone or Samsung Series colleagues and friends for their battery life. Welcome to the league. This offers an avg battery life. I never carried a charger with me in previous models if I Start with 90% even after two years. But here I have to carry it even for the average usage. I m wondering what would be this phone battery life in a year or more.4. 90 Hz refresh rate is a gimmick to sell this device. It will give you fluid experience but the soon it consumes battery you will always prefer to keep it to 60hz which is an option given in the display settings. If you always stick to a desk or have a power source around you can keep it to 90hz. Not for people who are on the move most of the time. Don't fall for it.5. Sound: It's average. Phone calls are not crisp and clear. At times the caller's voice gets hazy and husky. Voice is even audible to person the person sitting next to me. Even on lower volumes. Speakers volume is loud but the sound quality is not good.6. No premium-feeling anymore. With multiple variants, it has joined the league of Samsung, Mi, Oppo, Vivo. Now they are launching 7t pro on Oct 10 again it is a disappointment for those who bought 7t on day 1. Maybe their R&D or trials have some problem here that in every two months they are launching a new device with an update to the previous faults. Like OnePlus 7 has voice receiver on one side which is right. So if you take calls or hear the phone from left you won't get a clear voice or volume. So they added receivers on both the side in this device.I am still not getting why I have spent Rs 40,000 on it. No camera quality, no battery life, no sound quality on calls, getting wounds on holding it for long.I have always recommended OnePlus devices to everyone around and had high hopes and trust on the brand that I bought it on the day of the launch but with this experience, I won't recommend OnePlus 7t to my colleagues and friends who are planning to upgrade their devices."

Weight: It weighed too much I felt like holding a brick. And it is thick. When I hold it in one hand for a few minutes I get a deep red pit in my hand (due to blood circulation).2. Camera: Then I had to go for a conference there I tried clicking pictures. Picture quality did not come out well. Still, I thought it may be light or background because of my previous experiences I could not believe it to be not good. So I continued clicking pictures which really missed detailing. As you zoom in it will make it blurred. I have clicked a magazine cover picture with my Oneplus 5 which had only 16 MP camera but pic quality was natural and good. It clicks blur pics may it has to do with image Stabilization.3. Battery:  Battery is avg. All those time I teased my iPhone or Samsung Series colleagues and friends for their battery life. Welcome to the league. This offers an avg battery life. I never carried a charger with me in previous models if I Start with 90% even after two years. But here I have to carry it even for the average usage. I m wondering what would be this phone battery life in a year or more.4. 90 Hz refresh rate is a gimmick to sell this device. It will give you fluid experience but the soon it consumes battery you will always prefer to keep it to 60hz which is an option given in the display settings. If you always stick to a desk or have a power source around you can keep it to 90hz. Not for people who are on the move most of the time. Don't fall for it.5. Sound: It's average. Phone calls are not crisp and clear. At times the caller's voice gets hazy and husky. Voice is even audible to person the person sitting next to me. Even on lower volumes. Speakers volume is loud but the sound quality is not good.6. No premium-feeling anymore. With multiple variants, it has joined the league of Samsung, Mi, Oppo, Vivo. Now they are launching 7t pro on Oct 10 again it is a disappointment for those who bought 7t on day 1. Maybe their R&D or trials have some problem here that in every two months they are launching a new device with an update to the previous faults. Like OnePlus 7 has voice receiver on one side which is right. So if you take calls or hear the phone from left you won't get a clear voice or volume. So they added receivers on both the side in this device.I am still not getting why I have spent Rs 40,000 on it. No camera quality, no battery life, no sound quality on calls, getting wounds on holding it for long.I have always recommended OnePlus devices to everyone around and had high hopes and trust on the brand that I bought it on the day of the launch but with this experience, I won't recommend OnePlus 7t to my colleagues and friends who are planning to upgrade their devices."

Charging is fast as per the Oneplus standards set in earlier phones.What is concerning me is the heating issue which crops up off and on. The Battery drains quickly so we have to keep it at 60Hz to longer life. Is there anyone else feeling the heating issues?"
396,B07DJLVJ5M,OnePlus 7T,KESH,PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BUY THIS PHONE.,1.0,"THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST PHONE I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PHONE AND PUT YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON STAKE. THERE ARE SO MANY CONS IN THIS PHONE. EARLIER I HAVE USED ONE PLUS 5T PHONE SO I KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS PHONE BUT THIS TIME I AM SO MUCH DISAPPOINTED.HERE ARE MY CONCERNS1. SCREEN RESOLUTION AND QUALITY OF THE SCREEN IS SO POOR. THERE IS GRAINS AND COLOR BANDING ISSUE IN SCREEN. IMAGES LOOKS GRAINY AND UNSHARP IN COMPARISION TO ONE PLUS 5T OR 6T. PHONE RATIO IS 20:9 SO INSTAGRAM IMAGES WILL BE IN SHOWN IN PORTRAIT MODE INSTEAD OF LANDSCAPE MODE. IMAGES ON THE SCREEN IS SO BLURRRY2. DESIGN OF THE PHONE IS MESS. SO MUCH CAMERA BULK. EVEN THE PROVIDED CASE CANNOT PROTECT IT FROM SCRATCHES. PHONE IS VERY FAT AND HAEVY. LENGTH IS ALSO TOO MUCH BECAUSE OF THE RATIO. ALSO THERE IS NO PREMIUM FEELING AFTER HOLDING THIS PHONE AS WAS WITH THE ONE PLUS 5T.3. 3.5MM JACK IS BIG OMMISSION SINCE ONE PLUS 6 PHONE. THERE IS NO BENEFIT OF REMOVING IT. THERE IS NO BIGGER BATTERY. ALSO YOU HAVE TO BUY A SEPERATE ADAPTER OR NEW BLUTOOTH EARPHONES AND BLUTOOTH EARPHONES QUALITY CAN NEVER BE AS GOOD AS WIRED EARPHONES.4. CAMERA QUALITY IS AVERAGE. NO INCREASE IN PICTURE QUALITY. 3 CAMERAS ARE ONLY FOR NAME SAKE.I WAS VERY HAPPY ONE PLUS CUSTOMER, BUT NOW I WON'T RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYONE. PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY."

399,B07DJLVJ5M,OnePlus 7T,Nitish Kumar,Not recommended at all,4.0,"The smart Lock feature is not working on the phone. It doesn't require PIN/ fingerprint sensor sometimes.

And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery."
501,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,Sneha Jaiswal Singla,The phone got dead just after the initial setup,1.0,"This is to share my horrible experience with Amazon and Samsung. The phone arrived dead and I have to make multiple calls, emails to team to get it replaced. After technician report confirming that phone is dead they now asking me to go for a refund as product is no longer in stock."
502,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,Ysak,Jack of all trades!!,5.0,"Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August.All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.Display is gorgeous.Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment."
503,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,Narasimha,Disappointed completely 😑,1.0,"Strongly recommend No..why samsung make lot advertise on m31s.really don't know wt makes new compared to other M series. 'Single take' shot option really useless.People who r looking for camera please don't buy m31s.All the modes camers pictures are 95%blur mode.perfomance of mobile is not up to expectations.When turns into selife mode really shocked IS IT HD photo or Asian paints colored WALL.REALLY SHOCKED.THIS TIME SAMSUNG DISAPPOINTED.Videos display is also not so effective. Starting of series most of them said not  a gaming mobile.really its not gaming mobile.No samsung pay Nfc,No backcase,l.Rather than spending 20k on m31s supposed to switch another model.Name it as blur mobile.THANKS"
504,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,Amazon Customer,Screen blacked out in 2 days,5.0,"purchased the phone on very first day, delivered by amazon on the next day - excellent serviceabout phoneused it for 2 days and then screen blacked out and phone not workingtried many things as suggested by amazon tech team but its still not workingreplacement order placed but it shows 20 days to deliver next onenever expected this quality from samsung"
505,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,Kunal Dhulekar,Strictly Satisfactory.  Definitely not a flagship experience.,1.0,Initial impression after using for one day.1. The display is Gorgeous. Feels like a high end device2. Specs say 6000 MaH battery. Power management is not up to the mark. Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable.  Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this3.Camera: Impressive.  Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.4. Processor: Not the fastest out there  but does the job. Nothing to complain about5. Fingerprint scanner is decent.6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered.  Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery7. I believe the cost should have around 17K instead of 19.5k...! But if you want a non Chinese phone then this is a good option to consider
506,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,Anand Sawant,Best Buy with few compromise,1.0,I am using this for last 2-3 days now.This is my review after actually using this pgone in all aspects.Pros -1. Canera - Excellent camera - Good low light photography.  64 Megapixel does uts wor. Inteli Cam is just awesome.2. Display is just Superfine even in direct sunlight it works Excellent.Touch is just Excellent.3. Phone looks really cool in hands.4. Smart pop up feature is also good to have.5. UI is good.6. Speaker sound is good.7. No issues in calls - No call drips using Airtel sim.Overall its very nice experience using this phone.I researched alot before burying this phone and i am happy that i made this choice.Cons -1. Battery doesn't look like 6000 MAH it typically gives 1.5 days backup with single charge which other phone alao gives with relatively less Mah Battery.I was hoping to get little more backup2. Processor  - Could have been better3  No back cover for phone as it is hard to find in a market
507,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,Sagar B,Best mid range device to leave Chinese devices..,4.0,"An excellent device would not be an enough word to describe this phone.Got it through prime and Amazon delivered it before time once again delighted with wonderful service by Amazon and the device is a masterpiece.Loaded with awesome features like 1 click camera, 6000mah battery, reverse charging, bigger and butter smooth super amoled display.Samsung has started to capture the Indian market and that ultimately allow us as customers to get rid of data stealer and spy Chinese phones.You can definitely go for this phone blindly"
508,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,Amazon Customer,hanging too slow Don't buy don't disappoint be careful. don't trust Amazon,4.0,"Don't buy anyone worst product, Waste of money rs 18000. This product too much heating, display quality very low and touch screen not working, Camara is very worst like 2mp Camara, also don't trust Amazon. I have ordered credit card payment. they cancelled orders and not refunded. I have raised complaint against Amazon but no use. don't purchase in Amazon. Samsung m31s hanging even I am not installed single game"
509,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,Elavarasan Natarajan,Best buy for the price!,5.0,"Hi all,From Samsung M31s.Bought it on Amazon Prime day sale. Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India.Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC's 10% discount.But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn't come with the box and also wasn't available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby.Small review as per my knowledge -On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5"")Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency.While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine.Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times).Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between.Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too.Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities.But, doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received)No option to find app usage statistics.Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs.Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down.Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots.Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma.AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam.Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable.Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options.EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine,just on 10th day of my purchase, my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken 💔Handle with care."

Different features for Front cam and Back cam.Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable.Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options.EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine,just on 10th day of my purchase, my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken 💔Handle with care."
530,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,J.G.Krishnaa,HONEST M31s. HONEST PERFORMANCE. HONEST PRICE.,5.0,"Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery."

532,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,Ysak,Jack of all trades!!,5.0,"Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August.All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.Display is gorgeous.Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment."

535,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,Kunal Dhulekar,Strictly Satisfactory.  Definitely not a flagship experience.,1.0,Initial impression after using for one day.1. The display is Gorgeous. Feels like a high end device2. Specs say 6000 MaH battery. Power management is not up to the mark. Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable.  Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this3.Camera: Impressive.  Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.4. Processor: Not the fastest out there  but does the job. Nothing to complain about5. Fingerprint scanner is decent.6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered.  Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery7. I believe the cost should have around 17K instead of 19.5k...! But if you want a non Chinese phone then this is a good option to consider
536,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,Anand Sawant,Best Buy with few compromise,1.0,I am using this for last 2-3 days now.This is my review after actually using this pgone in all aspects.Pros -1.

No issues in calls - No call drips using Airtel sim.Overall its very nice experience using this phone.I researched alot before burying this phone and i am happy that i made this choice.Cons -1. Battery doesn't look like 6000 MAH it typically gives 1.5 days backup with single charge which other phone alao gives with relatively less Mah Battery.I was hoping to get little more backup2. Processor  - Could have been better3  No back cover for phone as it is hard to find in a market

Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby.Small review as per my knowledge -On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5"")Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency.While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine.Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times).Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between.Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too.Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities.But, doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received)No option to find app usage statistics.Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs.Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down.Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots.Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma.AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam.Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable.Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options.EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine,just on 10th day of my purchase, my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken 💔Handle with care."
560,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,J.G.Krishnaa,HONEST M31s. HONEST PERFORMANCE. HONEST PRICE.,5.0,"Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery."

562,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,Ysak,Jack of all trades!!,5.0,"Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August.All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.Display is gorgeous.Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment."

565,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,Kunal Dhulekar,Strictly Satisfactory.  Definitely not a flagship experience.,1.0,Initial impression after using for one day.1. The display is Gorgeous. Feels like a high end device2. Specs say 6000 MaH battery. Power management is not up to the mark. Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable.  Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this3.Camera: Impressive.  Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.4. Processor: Not the fastest out there  but does the job. Nothing to complain about5. Fingerprint scanner is decent.6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered.  Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery7. I believe the cost should have around 17K instead of 19.5k...! But if you want a non Chinese phone then this is a good option to consider

589,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,Elavarasan Natarajan,Best buy for the price!,5.0,"Hi all,From Samsung M31s.Bought it on Amazon Prime day sale. Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India.Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC's 10% discount.But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn't come with the box and also wasn't available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby.Small review as per my knowledge -On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5"")Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency.While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine.Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times).Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between.Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too.Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities.But, doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received)No option to find app usage statistics.Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs.Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down.Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots.Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma.AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam.Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable.Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options.EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine,just on 10th day of my purchase, my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken 💔Handle with care."
590,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,J.G.Krishnaa,HONEST M31s. HONEST PERFORMANCE. HONEST PRICE.,5.0,"Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery."
591,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,Sneha Jaiswal Singla,The phone got dead just after the initial setup,1.0,"This is to share my horrible experience with Amazon and Samsung. The phone arrived dead and I have to make multiple calls, emails to team to get it replaced. After technician report confirming that phone is dead they now asking me to go for a refund as product is no longer in stock."
592,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,Ysak,Jack of all trades!!,5.0,"Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August.All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.Display is gorgeous.Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment."
593,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,Narasimha,Disappointed completely 😑,1.0,"Strongly recommend No..why samsung make lot advertise on m31s.really don't know wt makes new compared to other M series. 'Single take' shot option really useless.People who r looking for camera please don't buy m31s.All the modes camers pictures are 95%blur mode.perfomance of mobile is not up to expectations.When turns into selife mode really shocked IS IT HD photo or Asian paints colored WALL.REALLY SHOCKED.THIS TIME SAMSUNG DISAPPOINTED.Videos display is also not so effective. Starting of series most of them said not  a gaming mobile.really its not gaming mobile.No samsung pay Nfc,No backcase,l.Rather than spending 20k on m31s supposed to switch another model.Name it as blur mobile.THANKS"
594,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,Amazon Customer,Screen blacked out in 2 days,5.0,"purchased the phone on very first day, delivered by amazon on the next day - excellent serviceabout phoneused it for 2 days and then screen blacked out and phone not workingtried many things as suggested by amazon tech team but its still not workingreplacement order placed but it shows 20 days to deliver next onenever expected this quality from samsung"
595,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,Kunal Dhulekar,Strictly Satisfactory.  Definitely not a flagship experience.,1.0,Initial impression after using for one day.1. The display is Gorgeous. Feels like a high end device2. Specs say 6000 MaH battery. Power management is not up to the mark. Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable.  Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this3.Camera: Impressive.  Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.4. Processor: Not the fastest out there  but does the job. Nothing to complain about5. Fingerprint scanner is decent.6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered.  Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery7. I believe the cost should have around 17K instead of 19.5k...! But if you want a non Chinese phone then this is a good option to consider
596,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,Anand Sawant,Best Buy with few compromise,1.0,I am using this for last 2-3 days now.This is my review after actually using this pgone in all aspects.Pros -1. Canera - Excellent camera - Good low light photography.  64 Megapixel does uts wor. Inteli Cam is just awesome.2. Display is just Superfine even in direct sunlight it works Excellent.Touch is just Excellent.3. Phone looks really cool in hands.4. Smart pop up feature is also good to have.5. UI is good.6. Speaker sound is good.7. No issues in calls - No call drips using Airtel sim.Overall its very nice experience using this phone.I researched alot before burying this phone and i am happy that i made this choice.Cons -1. Battery doesn't look like 6000 MAH it typically gives 1.5 days backup with single charge which other phone alao gives with relatively less Mah Battery.I was hoping to get little more backup2. Processor  - Could have been better3  No back cover for phone as it is hard to find in a market
597,B07DJCJBBN,Samsung Galaxy M31s,Sagar B,Best mid range device to leave Chinese devices..,4.0,"An excellent device would not be an enough word to describe this phone.Got it through prime and Amazon delivered it before time once again delighted with wonderful service by Amazon and the device is a masterpiece.Loaded with awesome features like 1 click camera, 6000mah battery, reverse charging, bigger and butter smooth super amoled display.Samsung has started to capture the Indian market and that ultimately allow us as customers to get rid of data stealer and spy Chinese phones.You can definitely go for this phone blindly"

If any body hurts, I feel sorry, but I revealed the truth.You can get far better mobile with this price of ₹18, 500.

It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use. So, my honest review is, in 2020 this is an awesome choice and great value for money if you have big hands."

It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use.

685,B077PWJRFH,Redmi Note 9 Pro Max,Aravi,It's a great phone!,4.0,"Awsome product. I had my doubts buying another Redmi device after my mom bought one for herself 1 year ago. It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use. So, my honest review is, in 2020 this is an awesome choice and great value for money if you have big hands."

690,B077PWJRFH,Redmi Note 9 Pro Max,Ravi Murthy,Really amazing phone,5.0,Actually asusual best phone by redmi.Amazing phone design with best quality camera. Very excellent built quality. It comes with 33w fast charging which is really fast.But I wish it would have 90hz refresh rate.
691,B077PWJRFH,Redmi Note 9 Pro Max,BHABATOSH DAS,No reason to buy Redmi Note 9 Pro Max,1.0,"Please don't buy it.It's not a quality mobile, it just like Redmi Note 4.  No special features added in Redmi Note 9 Pro Max which can be differentiate with Note 4.  Battery is not so good, it doesn't retain power long time.  Other company's mobile are giving some special technology like Samsung M31 (6000 mah battery, Amoled Screen, sony camera lense and so many features) in lesser price.  It is not a value for money, not a good product.  Why the company has fixed so high price? The answer I would like to knowfrom company.  After purchasing it feel nothing worthy with the set because I am still using Redmi note 4. Just looting with custom in the Covid 19 pandemic situation.  No discount isoffered in credit card nor no cost EMI nor Exchange in flash sale.  In the name of flash sale seller makes fool to us. This is my personal experience and opinion.  If any body hurts, I feel sorry, but I revealed the truth.You can get far better mobile with this price of ₹18, 500. Its a cheating with the customer because price is high but no quality improvement in comparison with Redmi Note 4.  I feel better Redmi note 4 with lesser price than 9 Pro Max."
692,B077PWJRFH,Redmi Note 9 Pro Max,Musani Jainul,Worst performance... Waste of money.,5.0,Product performance is poor.Its speed is like 2 GB RAM mobile.Processor is too slow feels like very old mobiles.Battery drains very fast.Worst mobile performance.Not even like Redmi Note 4.Waste of money. 17000 is too much price for such poor performance.I think worst product from Xiaomi RedMi.Samsung M31 is far better in performance and battery.

I am not a gamer or don't run any app to consume high performance. I have the regular banking and social apps and default phone apps. Internal memory not consumed more then 20gb. Still this phone takes time to load home page. This is really ridiculous.2. Some modes in this phone are not working exactly upto the mark.A. Dark mode - it will not change to dark mode by the time I select, May change when phone wishes to do. Viseversa if i would like deselect dark mode.B. When loading - screen flickering occurs often in many common applications. GDrive, Gpay, whatsapp and opera browser.C. Receivers are not seeing my face in whatsapp app video call, in duo its working fine. Only in my call receivers facing this issue.Camera I did not test much, but I didn't see any issues. Clarity is good.Finget scan is not fast compare to competitor phones.My overall rating is 1 for 5Complaint s registered with Amazon, Technician did not visit to inspect the phone.

800,B07KXC7WQZ,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,Vijender Singh,"Its a balanced phone....great on all fronts.....the display,sound, performance, battery life 👌",5.0,"The phone looks gorgeous....the build and design is top notch....and the display is best in class, amazing contrast ,colour and brightness, visibility in sunlight is perfect,great battery life , ultra smooth UI, the physical size is perfect (can be handled easily).The ultra wide lens take great,unique shots , dynamic range is improved from previous generation,front camera is good but not able to match to iphone xs max or pixel.Bundled AKG headfones sound awesome and the speaker on this phone are loud and sound great....calling is pleasure ( sufficient loundness of mic input and earpiece output)The Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor works great....but sometime misses as the physical sensor area is tiny....but it's more secure than an optical indisplay sensor.The only weak point is i think front camera (though being very good)Anyone thinking of buying it ....go ahead guys the looks and screen on this phone are exceptional.....and every other thing is great too."
801,B07KXC7WQZ,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,Jithy,Happy for the before time delivery but the phone had a software glitch.,1.0,"Got the phone on time (7th March 19 morning) and was very happy with your early delivery. The 1st impression was amazing and the smart switch option was very convenient to transfer the content from my previous Galaxy to this new amazing S10 plus. However after the software updated ,there was a technical glitch. The entire screen went into a black-and-white screen and it was not possible to reverse it with the regular settings. Had to reset the phone with factory reset. This entire process took 4 to 5 hours and this was a bitter experience. Hope this problem does not arise after sometime  again and it was just a software glitch.I have always been a Samsung fan and have possessed the galaxy phones from the Note 2 times.This experience was a bit unnerving but keeping my fingers crossed and hope to have an amazing experience going forward."

807,B07KXC7WQZ,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,Soumalya Chakraborty,Excellent Cameras and Performance,5.0,"Had pre-ordered and was waiting impatiently for it to get delivered. Finally, it arrived on 8th and this review is based upon approximately 2.5 days of usage.Display: Simply awesome. This is my first Samsung smartphone with their famed dynamic AMOLED display and it doesn't disappoint one bit. The default ""vibrant"" setting puts out great, punchy colours and images, wallpapers and videos look great. Undoubtedly, one of the best devices for content consumption.Audio: No complaints. Sounds clean and clear. The supplied AKG earbuds are an added bonus.Design: Looks deservedly upmarket with the glass and metal body. For ages, I had a mental block against Samsung as they made the flagship Galaxy series with plastic builds but for the last few generations, not anymore.

Had to reset the phone with factory reset. This entire process took 4 to 5 hours and this was a bitter experience. Hope this problem does not arise after sometime  again and it was just a software glitch.I have always been a Samsung fan and have possessed the galaxy phones from the Note 2 times.This experience was a bit unnerving but keeping my fingers crossed and hope to have an amazing experience going forward."

Finally, it arrived on 8th and this review is based upon approximately 2.5 days of usage.Display: Simply awesome. This is my first Samsung smartphone with their famed dynamic AMOLED display and it doesn't disappoint one bit. The default ""vibrant"" setting puts out great, punchy colours and images, wallpapers and videos look great. Undoubtedly, one of the best devices for content consumption.Audio: No complaints. Sounds clean and clear. The supplied AKG earbuds are an added bonus.Design: Looks deservedly upmarket with the glass and metal body. For ages, I had a mental block against Samsung as they made the flagship Galaxy series with plastic builds but for the last few generations, not anymore. You positively feel like you're holding a premium product. The Bixby and volume rocker keys on my device have a little play though. Would have been great if they were firmer.Performance: Again, smooth and hiccup-free. Does get a little warm at times though, and not necessarily with heavy tasks. The 4150 mAH battery lasted around 1.5 days so that's great.Cameras: A casual photographer can't ask for much better. Images come out great with plenty of detail, accurate colours and sharpness. Capable under low light too (don't compare with Pixels though). Do try out the wide angle lenses. They are really useful to have.Overall, it's mostly all round great experience so far.

Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point !

905,B077PWK5BY,OnePlus 8 Pro,Arindam Singh,A great feature rich phone but has Display issues.,1.0,"I bought this 12GB+256GB Glacial Green variant and physically it looks stunning. The design is top-notch. The punch hole camera does not spoil the overall screen experience as some people have said. Very sleek and premium looking design-wise. The battery life does not last really long when you use it on 120 Hz QHD+, although it's quite manageable and can get through the day with mid usage easily. Coming to gaming, I'm a hardcore gamer and can game continuously for 3-4 hours, and let me tell you this phone can run through it with ease. I've played PUBG quite a lot on this device and have not noticed any major frame drops at HDR graphics and Extreme frame rates, let alone Smooth graphics. It runs PUBG really smoothly. Stable frames at all times. I would suggest it for competitive PUBG and other games too. The 120 Hz Amoled screen is breathtaking. Buttery smooth at all times. Certainly the best display on a phone. I have found the cameras to be decent enough. Nothing too fancy, nor a let down. Videos are very stable though. This has come close to the iPhone cameras as a video shooter. This might even offer better stabilization than the iPhone videos. The colour filter camera is disabled out of the box. Speakers are fairly loud and clear. A very good surround experience. You'll find a Dolby sample video in your gallery. Play it on the phone speakers and see for yourself.Here comes the bad part about it. The phone that I had received, I used it for about 2 weeks and discovered it had this image retention issue. The afterimage of anything displayed for a period of time on the phone for a long time is displayed on the screen even after the original image is pulled off. This could be seen while watching Youtube videos in non-fill screen mode or videos that have any kind of frame visible or even games like PUBG where static elements of game like the map's frame or your controls would be visible on certain background colours even after you have turned the game off. I had reset the phone and not seen any kind of improvement. I checked on the community and many people have experienced this issue as well. The hole-punch band issue is there but it was very vague and DC dimming could fix it. Also, my screen had no green tints. The image retention issue could easily turn into permanent screen burns really soon. So, I have returned my product for now and plan to buy the same phone again.Hope you people find this review useful. Not a very organized review but that's what I have experienced."

924,B077PWK5BY,OnePlus 8 Pro,Aman Singh,Dont buy it.Display is not upto the mark,3.0,"I bought the phone during the first sale on 15June.I was very excited for the phone due to all the hype on the social media and what not.It was amazing at first,blazing fast speed,120hz refresh rate and the display was gorgeous to look at,but after around 9th day,my display was having issues and after 11 days,half the screen would show a weird purple tint while watching youtube in dark mode and using chrome and apps with similar black color.My whole experience was ruined,so much that i sold the phone at ₹3000 loss.I'm 99% sure,no matter where you buy the phone,it would have some display issues in one way or another which is very disappointing.I urge you to stay away from this phone as the screen is not calibrated like it should've been.Totally not worth your hard earned money."
925,B077PWK5BY,OnePlus 8 Pro,Arindam Singh,A great feature rich phone but has Display issues.,1.0,"I bought this 12GB+256GB Glacial Green variant and physically it looks stunning. The design is top-notch. The punch hole camera does not spoil the overall screen experience as some people have said. Very sleek and premium looking design-wise. The battery life does not last really long when you use it on 120 Hz QHD+, although it's quite manageable and can get through the day with mid usage easily. Coming to gaming, I'm a hardcore gamer and can game continuously for 3-4 hours, and let me tell you this phone can run through it with ease. I've played PUBG quite a lot on this device and have not noticed any major frame drops at HDR graphics and Extreme frame rates, let alone Smooth graphics. It runs PUBG really smoothly. Stable frames at all times. I would suggest it for competitive PUBG and other games too. The 120 Hz Amoled screen is breathtaking. Buttery smooth at all times. Certainly the best display on a phone. I have found the cameras to be decent enough. Nothing too fancy, nor a let down. Videos are very stable though. This has come close to the iPhone cameras as a video shooter. This might even offer better stabilization than the iPhone videos. The colour filter camera is disabled out of the box. Speakers are fairly loud and clear. A very good surround experience. You'll find a Dolby sample video in your gallery. Play it on the phone speakers and see for yourself.Here comes the bad part about it. The phone that I had received, I used it for about 2 weeks and discovered it had this image retention issue. The afterimage of anything displayed for a period of time on the phone for a long time is displayed on the screen even after the original image is pulled off. This could be seen while watching Youtube videos in non-fill screen mode or videos that have any kind of frame visible or even games like PUBG where static elements of game like the map's frame or your controls would be visible on certain background colours even after you have turned the game off. I had reset the phone and not seen any kind of improvement. I checked on the community and many people have experienced this issue as well. The hole-punch band issue is there but it was very vague and DC dimming could fix it. Also, my screen had no green tints. The image retention issue could easily turn into permanent screen burns really soon. So, I have returned my product for now and plan to buy the same phone again.Hope you people find this review useful. Not a very organized review but that's what I have experienced."

You'll find a Dolby sample video in your gallery. Play it on the phone speakers and see for yourself.Here comes the bad part about it. The phone that I had received, I used it for about 2 weeks and discovered it had this image retention issue. The afterimage of anything displayed for a period of time on the phone for a long time is displayed on the screen even after the original image is pulled off. This could be seen while watching Youtube videos in non-fill screen mode or videos that have any kind of frame visible or even games like PUBG where static elements of game like the map's frame or your controls would be visible on certain background colours even after you have turned the game off. I had reset the phone and not seen any kind of improvement. I checked on the community and many people have experienced this issue as well. The hole-punch band issue is there but it was very vague and DC dimming could fix it. Also, my screen had no green tints. The image retention issue could easily turn into permanent screen burns really soon. So, I have returned my product for now and plan to buy the same phone again.Hope you people find this review useful. Not a very organized review but that's what I have experienced."

Phone always stay warm unless you sit in AC room.It heats a lot even during normal usage.During charging its heat a lot .Front camera of this phone is Just pathetic.In whatsapp video call is worse. Slight background light fades away all the details.Even with default camera app,the front camera is bad.

975,B077PWK5BY,OnePlus 8 Pro,Arindam Singh,A great feature rich phone but has Display issues.,1.0,"I bought this 12GB+256GB Glacial Green variant and physically it looks stunning. The design is top-notch. The punch hole camera does not spoil the overall screen experience as some people have said. Very sleek and premium looking design-wise. The battery life does not last really long when you use it on 120 Hz QHD+, although it's quite manageable and can get through the day with mid usage easily. Coming to gaming, I'm a hardcore gamer and can game continuously for 3-4 hours, and let me tell you this phone can run through it with ease. I've played PUBG quite a lot on this device and have not noticed any major frame drops at HDR graphics and Extreme frame rates, let alone Smooth graphics. It runs PUBG really smoothly. Stable frames at all times. I would suggest it for competitive PUBG and other games too. The 120 Hz Amoled screen is breathtaking. Buttery smooth at all times. Certainly the best display on a phone.
